 * Performs Cetification Test #6 For WildWest reseller
 * Domain Name Renewal
 * 
 * Instructions: Use the OrderPrivateDomainRenewals() method to renew the domain name
 * "example.biz" for one additional year. Because privacy has been added to "example.biz",
 * this resource will have to be renewed, also.
 *
 * Result: The return XML should return a message indicating that the two domains and one
 * privacy account were successfully renewed.
 *
 * Additional Information:
 * Product IDs
 *  + .BIZ 1-year domain name renewal - 350087
 *  + Privacy 1-year renewal - 387001
 *
 * User
 * A unique user identifier was created and returned during the certification task in section
 * 4.1.2. This identifier also appears in the return XML from the certification task
 * described in section 7.1.3
 *
 * Resource IDs
 * The resource IDs for both domains were retrieved using the previous call to the Poll()
 * method. The DBP resource ID must be retrieved via a new Poll() method call.
 * This will return information from the domain name privacy order from the task
 * described in section 4.1.3.
